          During World War II, the Manhattan Project was a top-secret research
          and development project with the goal of developing the first nuclear
          weapons. The project, which was actively supported by the United
          States and included the UK and Canada, was motivated by fears that
          Nazi Germany was creating nuclear weapons. General Leslie Groves and
          J. Robert Oppenheimer, the project's scientific directors, oversaw the
          $2 billion venture. The project led to the development of the first
          nuclear weapons, which were employed in the August 1945 atomic
          bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. It significantly affected domestic
          politics, international relations, and science and technology.

          Nuclear weapons played a significant role during the Cold War, a time
          of tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. An arms
          race resulted from both nations' developing sizable nuclear arsenals.
          The threat of mutually assured destruction (MAD) from nuclear weapons
          was also employed as a deterrent to avert direct conflict. The number
          of nuclear weapons has been restricted through the signing of arms
          control agreements like SALT and ABM. During the Cold War, the threat
          of nuclear war had a significant impact on society and raised worries
          about the possible outcomes of a nuclear conflict.
        </li>
        <li>
          International relations are impacted by nuclear weapons in a
          complicated and contentious way. Due to their potential for
          destruction, they act as a deterrent and prevent nations from using
          them. Nuclear and non-nuclear states are now divided by the possession
          of nuclear weapons, with non-nuclear states frequently supporting
          disarmament. Although the threat of nuclear retaliation kept things
          peaceful during the Cold War, there is still cause for concern
          regarding the spread of nuclear weapons to numerous nations. Nuclear
          weapons continue to play a significant role in determining
          international relations and the balance of power.
